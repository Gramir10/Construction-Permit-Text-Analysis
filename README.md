# Construction Permit Text Analysis: Understanding Permit Requests in Baltimore City

# Abstract
### For this project, our team aimed to properly understand the nature of Baltimore City permit requests to better analyze economic patterns and predictions resulting from construction projects. Additionally, at the request of the department, we deduced how to best locate those affected by unforeseen accidents, primarily those affected by recent sewage and plumbing issues. By tracking permits, we were able to investigate Baltimore’s development projections, address keywords needed for tracking both date and location of associated permits, and, based on construction permit data, ask the question, “how can we best contact individuals who are affected by this data?”
